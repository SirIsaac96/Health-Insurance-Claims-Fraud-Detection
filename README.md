# HEALTH INSURANCE CLAIMS FRAUD DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING (Data Science Capstone Project)
## Problem Description
Health insurance claims fraud poses a significant challenge in the healthcare industry, leading to considerable financial losses and increased costs for insurance providers and consumers. In Kenya, like in many other countries around the world, fraudulent activities such as billing for services not rendered, falsifying claim or patient information and many other deceptive practices are impacting the healthcare industry. To prevent the integrity of the healthcare insurance system, it is essential to develop effective methods to detect and prevent such fraudulent claims.
The prevalence of healthcare insurance fraud in Kenya and around the world is reported by a number of resources. Fraudulent practices in healthcare insurance claims are carried out with a high level of complexity, which makes it challenging to identify them using traditional methods. The challenge goes beyond financial repercussions, as it also undermines confidence in the healthcare insurance system and further burdens the already resource-constrained healthcare ecosystem. Effectively addressing this challenge is essential to safeguard the financial stability of insurance providers, protect the interests of the consumers, and maintain the overall integrity of the healthcare insurance industry.
The significance of addressing healthcare insurance claims fraud cannot be overstated. Beyond the immediate financial impact on insurance providers, the consequences extend throughout the entire healthcare system. Fraudulent claims contribute to rising healthcare costs, resulting in higher premiums and reduced access to healthcare services for the population. Additionally, healthcare fraud diverts resources away from legitimate medical needs, potentially denying necessary treatments to individuals and families. By developing robust and fraud detection mechanisms, we not only protect the financial health of insurance providers but also ensure that healthcare insurance remains a dependable means of healthcare financing for the well-being of society as a whole.
## Proposed Solution
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent healthcare insurance claims submitted to health insurance providers.
Traditional fraud detection approaches in healthcare insurance, such as planned and targeted audits, random audits, whistleblowing, reliance on manual processes, and basic computerized systems, often face limitations in identifying complex fraudulent activities. These approaches may struggle to keep pace with evolving fraud schemes, leading to undetected fraudulent claims and potential financial losses for insurance providers and consumers.
By levering a variety of supervised classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and XGBoost, this project seeks to identify fraudulent patterns and characteristics within health insurance claims data. These models represent a significant advancement over traditional approaches by enabling the automated identification of complex fraud patterns and enhancing the accuracy of detection.
The machine learning model developed through this project has the potential to significantly improve fraud detection in the healthcare insurance industry in Kenya. By accurately identifying fraudulent claims, insurance providers can take proactive measures to prevent financial losses and maintain the integrity of the insurance system. Additionally, this project may serve as a foundation for future efforts to combat healthcare insurance fraud on a broader scale.
## Data Source
Data from health insurance firms in Kenya could not be obtained due to security and privacy reasons. Therefore, the data that was used for this capstone project was gathered from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) in the form of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files. The data met the objectives of this project and is available for public use. The data files contain inpatient and outpatient claims, provider and beneficiary details.
